1. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

In today's competitive job market, candidates increasingly exaggerate or falsify 
information on resumes. While traditional rule-based systems can catch some 
fraudulent entries, they fall short when faced with ambiguous data, large 
datasets, or subtle textual manipulations.

This project proposes a hybrid solution that:
- Leverages Java OOPs for robust modular design
- Integrates Machine Learning models for enhanced verification
- Recognizes patterns and detects anomalies
- Improves accuracy and scalability of fake resume detection

================================================================================
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================

Recruiters face significant challenges in authenticating resumes due to:
- Advanced falsification tactics
- High volume of applications
- Time constraints in manual verification
- Ambiguous or inconsistent information

Solution Required: An automated, modular detection system combining rule-based 
logic and machine learning to efficiently screen and flag suspicious resumes.

================================================================================
3. OBJECTIVES
================================================================================

Primary Objectives:
1. Design a modular resume detector using Java OOPs principles
2. Implement rule-based validation for basic fake detection
3. Integrate Machine Learning models for advanced detection
4. Create a scalable system with database and ML pipeline integration

Secondary Objectives:
1. Demonstrate all major OOPs principles in Java
2. Show practical ML integration without APIs
3. Create a terminal-based user interface
4. Provide comprehensive documentation

================================================================================
4. SCOPE OF PROJECT

================================================================================
5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

5.1 Java OOPs Architecture

Package: models/
  - Resume.java: Data model for resume with full encapsulation
  - ValidationResult.java: Stores validation results with report generation

Package: validators/
  - BaseValidator.java: Abstract base class (inheritance, abstraction)
  - KeywordValidator.java: Specific validation strategy
  - ExperienceValidator.java: Specific validation strategy
  - DegreeValidator.java: Specific validation strategy
  - RuleBasedValidator.java: Orchestrator using composition

Package: ml/
  - MLPredictor.java: Loads and uses trained ML models
  - TextPreprocessor.java: Text normalization and cleaning

Package: parser/
  - ResumeParser.java: Regex-based information extraction

Package: storage/
  - ResultDatabase.java: File-based result persistence

Package: ui/
  - CLIInterface.java: Terminal user interface

5.2 OOPs Principles Demonstrated

1. ENCAPSULATION
   - Private fields with public getters/setters in Resume.java
   - Protected helper methods in BaseValidator.java
   - Data hiding in ValidationResult.java

2. INHERITANCE
   - BaseValidator abstract class extended by:
     * KeywordValidator
     * ExperienceValidator
     * DegreeValidator
   - All validators inherit common functionality

3. POLYMORPHISM
   - Abstract method validate() implemented differently
   - Each validator has unique validation logic
   - Method overriding in subclasses

4. ABSTRACTION
   - BaseValidator hides complex validation details
   - MLPredictor abstracts ML model usage
   - TextPreprocessor abstracts preprocessing logic

5. COMPOSITION
   - RuleBasedValidator uses multiple validators
   - CLIInterface composes validators, parser, database
   - Composite scoring in calculateFinalScore()

5.3 Design Patterns

1. STRATEGY PATTERN
   - Different validation strategies for different data types
   - Easily extensible for new validators

2. ABSTRACT FACTORY
   - Validator creation in RuleBasedValidator
   - Flexible validator instantiation

3. SINGLETON (Implicit)
   - Single instance of ResultDatabase per execution
   - Single MLPredictor instance
